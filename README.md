# Subkey Charisma
Hi thereüëã! This is little Subkey, who likes web coding.

## About my name
Why is my id "bylx666"? nobody knows, however I am a energy reducer. You cannot preview what I am going to do, so do myself. 

My name is Subkey Charisma, means the secondary Key(So it is essencial but not important?!). With balanced feeling, subkey is the suited one for my name. Charisma is just because I am so lucky that I think it is from the god.

## About my web
I am always resisting from frames using in one web app, because they are cost of energy and performance. If I am really needing a frame, I try to learn from 
similar frames to build my own one. For example I have writen a websocket frame in nodejs that is only in 300 lines(including lots of line breaks and notes). I feel proud of owning my self frames that is controllable, easy and fast. 
Getting close to web, I also do so in front end coding. If you are asking me grammars about jq or react, I am now really knowing nothing. I use easy Object to manage multi-page webs, in easy `pageTo()` you can jump to everywhere. I think my interest of web coding is almost from building frames that is different from others.
