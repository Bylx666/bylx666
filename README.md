# U have found a normal boy in Github.

He left something to make everyone learn more about him.

* ### First, the biggest, he has a bipolar disorder. He felt very helpless because his illness shows its effect almost any time. One of the trait of the illness is that he will be very CHEERFUL, or DEPRESSTIVE in any time.
> #### Cheerful time
>
> * Look at his head picture, it was filled with happiness. There is happy Sans playing instrument. That's setted in his cheerful time. Maybe you think he is happy every day. In fact, he is just in pain. He even lost most friends.
> * The only one knows him is himself. Only he knows the dangerous of his "happy time". It brings him happiness by DA(dopamine), but makes him impulsive to anything and everyone. He even thought he is often right and tries to control his impulse, but always fails. He almost lost his hope and now he is trying to face it.
>
> #### Depresstive time
>
> * It often appears in Fall and Winter. He doesn't want to do anything, even what he likes. He just stay in the bed and play his mobile phone. Without phone, he just keeps sleeping. He never gets up early in the Repressive time.
> * He sometimes thinks he is so bad that he isn't able to face anyone, including the girl likes him. He always tries his best to do anything what is for others, and checks for such a long time. But after publish in the class group, there is just little time to use them.

* ### Second, he is an obsessive. This is all DUED TO HIMSELF. When he is worried about his school marks, he thinks if there is something wrong in himself. So he has started a war with his body.

> * He worries about almost anything, especial what effects his state of mind. For example, when he is gotten into the depresstive time, he thinks he is having a bad time and it may impact on his studying, and he tries his best to move himself away from it. In fact, he put his mind on the "moving away", but not listening to the teacher.
> * He always checks for anything. He also tries to do anything what is done by one of his hand for the second time by another hand. He often falls into worries about what he've thought, and what he've done, and always check if they are "right".
