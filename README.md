# Wow! You'v found an amazing boy in Github!ðŸ˜€ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Now, here's the boy's infomation.

> * First, he is very lazyðŸ˜ª. He doesn't want to write any codes so there's no coding resp. .
>
> * Second, he doesn't like to learn something newðŸ¤—. He even never checks his grammarsðŸ˜´.
>
> * Third, he isn't good at English. He perhaps doesn't have a high mark in English testsðŸ™„. These bad grammars are the prooves.
>
> * Fourth, he is a fan of undertale. He likes Chara in the characters. In China, we say "Would you like a cup of Chara(tea, they have the same pronunciation 'ChÃ¡' in Chinese)?" That's maybe because she is a little cute because of her knives with blood, and somebody wants to drink her.
>
> * Fifth, he can't write a good passage, especially README files. For example, this file, there is no order in the passage. He just like to make something fun, but not put time in writing passages.
>
> * Sixly, he seldom sleeps well at night, so he often stays up late to do something new or interesting such as browsing Github or QQzone.
>
> * Finally, after reading this README.md, he seems a little strange. That's he.

>Why not have a look on him?

## Have a good day todayðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜€ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
